# Chemical Library Automation: 96-Well Plate Mapping

This project provides a Python utility for high-throughput screening (HTS) 
workflows. It automates the visualization of chemical libraries into standard 
96-well plate formats, a critical step for using liquid handling robotics.

### Relevance to Münster / LowDataML:
- **Automation:** Directly addresses the need for automated synthetic methods 
  as mentioned in the MSCA project description.
- **Reproducibility:** Standardizes plate layouts for catalytic robustness 
  screening (Glorius Group).

### Output Example:
![Plate Map](plate_map.png)

### Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
