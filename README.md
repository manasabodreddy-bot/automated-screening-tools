# automated-screening-tools
Python tools for 96-well plate mapping and high-throughput reaction optimization.
# High-Throughput Automation for Sustainable Chemistry

This project demonstrates a Python-based workflow for automating laboratory 
robotics (Liquid Handlers). 

### Key Features:
- **Automated Mapping:** Converts chemical lists into 96-well plate coordinates.
- **Low-Data Compatible:** Designed for rapid screening of catalyst libraries.
- **Münster Context:** Directly applicable to the Glorius Group's high-throughput 
  robustness screening protocols.

### Technical Stack:
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn (for visualization).
- Prepared for integration with Opentrons/Hamilton robotic APIs.
